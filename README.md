🏧 ATM Machine Simulation (Java Console Project)
📌 Project Overview

This project is a Java console-based ATM Machine simulation.
It allows users to securely log in using a PIN system and perform basic banking operations such as checking balance, withdrawing money, depositing money, and exiting the system.

The project is designed to demonstrate object-oriented programming concepts (OOP) in Java, including:
Class & Object usage
Methods and encapsulation
Conditional statements
Loops
User input handling with Scanner

🚀 Features

🔑 PIN Authentication → Only correct PIN grants access (default: 4564).
📊 Check Balance → Displays current account balance.
💸 Withdraw Money → Withdraws amount if sufficient balance is available.
💰 Deposit Money → Allows users to deposit money.
❌ Exit Option → Safe exit from ATM menu.
🔄 Looping Menu → Users can perform multiple operations until they choose to exit.

🖥️ How It Works
User runs the program.
Program asks for a PIN.
If correct → access granted.
If incorrect → denied with an error message.

Main menu displays options:
1 → Check Balance
2 → Withdraw Money
3 → Deposit Money
4 → Exit

User selects options until they exit.

🛠️ Technologies Used
